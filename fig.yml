# Experimenting with http://www.fig.sh/
# To run this on docker:
#
#    fig build
#    fig start
#
# Use fig logs to watch the logs, which 
# should show the links between containers.
#
# Use fig scale to start more clients and
# servers.

server:
  build: server
  expose:
  - "1234"
  - "8000"

client:
  build: client

# Use this to set REF_HOST on a boot2docker mac setup,
# before running fig:
#   export REF_HOST=$(boot2docker ssh "set | grep SSH_CLIENT" | cut -d"'" -f2 | cut -d" " -f1)
# And have a server for that host, on :8000/works.txt
hostaccess:
